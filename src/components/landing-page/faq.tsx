            Why does it sometimes take longer to load?
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            Because Filewrite is hosted on Render’s free tier, servers may go
            into “sleep” mode after periods of inactivity. The first load after
            inactivity can take a few seconds as the server spins back up.

        <AccordionItem value="item-2">
          <AccordionTrigger>Is Filewrite free to use?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            Yes. Filewrite is completely free and runs on Render’s free tier.

        <AccordionItem value="item-3">
          <AccordionTrigger>Do I need an account to use it?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            No. You can instantly create a shareable link for the text box or
            canvas without signing up.
